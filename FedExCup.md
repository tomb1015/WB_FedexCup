# Wormburners FEDEX Cup

## What is the FEDEX Cup

The PGA TOUR entered a new era in 2007 with the introduction of the FEDEX Cup, a season-long points competition offering $35 million in bonus money and culminating with the PGA TOUR’s first-ever Playoff system. The four Playoffs events offer $32 million in prize money, meaning a total of $67 million is on the line over the four weeks of FEDEX Cup Playoff competition.

In 2018 we are going to introduce this to the Wormburners.  This is not part of the league, it is optional just like the weekly par 3’s. The prize money will be based off the number of people who join the cup chase. It won’t be $67 million.

## Who can join

Any member of the Wormburners golf league that is a member before the first official game of the league and has a current league handicap.

## Do I have to join the FEDEX cup

The FEDEX cup is completely optional. It is a side event similar to the weekly par 3 competition.

## How much does it cost

It will cost $25 a person to join this cover the cost for the entire season. Payouts will be during the Wormburners awards ceremony at the end of the season. Can’t let the commish have all the fun.

## How is the cash awarded

Money collected will be split between the top 3 points positions. First place will get 50%, second place will get 30%, and third place will get 20%. For example if 40 people join at $25 per person($1000), first place will receive $500, second will receive $300, and third will receive $200.

## How are points awarded

Points are awarded used the standard PGA FEDEX Cup points system for regular tour events. In the table below you will see the point for position 1 thru 45. We will assign the points based off of each weeks scoring using the net score of each player in the cup. In case of a tie, point totals are added together and divided among all golfers tied for a particular position at the end of a tournament. For example, if four golfers finish tied for fifth place, the fifth through eighth place points are summed and divided by four, with each of the golfers receiving the same number of points.
